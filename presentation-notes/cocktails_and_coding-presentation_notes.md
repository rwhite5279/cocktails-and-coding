2. Wifi access. Needed for trinket.io access
3. Projector (+ dark room). For demonstrating.
4. Instructor laptop prepped, with dongle.
5. Software used: Terminal, Text editor, Browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome)
6. Other hardware/props:
    1. binary demo device
7. Cocktails!

Curriculum (2 hours, not including drinking)
--------------------------------------------

### 1. Computer Science introduction - 15 min
1. Computer Science vs. Computer Programming (explanation)  
    
    *Computer Science* is the study of problem-solving and *algorithms*, the series of steps that can be used to solve a given type of problem. *Computer Programming* is concerned with writing actual programs--in Java or Python--that implement the algorithms. Most CS courses involve a little bit of both.  
    
    Example: Mathematician Gauss, as a child, given the task to add the numbers from 1 to 100. Teacher anticipated that the typical problem-solving approach would keep Gauss busy for a while. Gauss recognized a different *algorithm*: 50 pairs of numbers that all sum to 101. More generally, (n / 2) * (n + 1). Gauss identified the two types of algorithms, and a programmer would write code that would implement each algorithm.
    
2. binary system - [binary_demo](./binary_demo/binary_demo.md)
3. computer running binary ([Flippy Switch Week on an IMSAI 8080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdP8WB8Dwbg)
4. encapsulation ([notes](./encapsulation.md))
5. c -> assembly -> binary  (computer demo)

### 2. File system with window environment
1. files
2. folders (directories)
 
### 3. Terminal - digging around on computer a little - 15 min  
Commands to try: 
1. `pwd`
2. `ls (~, Desktop, -l, -r)`
3. `^c`
4. `cd`
5. `top`
6. `python`
7. `sudo kill -9` [terminal window]

### 4. Computational Thinking
1. Programming requires thinking about problems creatively
    1. Counting words - [2 algorithms](./counting-words.md): spaces, inWord / not inWord (5 min)
    2. Anagrams - [multiple solutions](./anagrams.md) (5 min)
2. Jim Reekes video [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tmtrO2s7dYY) (5 min)

### 5. Python using [trinket.io](trinket.io) . Programmed together:
1. [helloworld.py](../code/helloworld.py) - print statement (5 min)
2. [helloworld-personal.py](../code/helloworld-personal.py) - (input statement, assignment (5 min)
3. [happybirthday.py](../code/happybirthday.py) - working w/ numbers, changing values (10 min)
4. [secretmessage.py](../code/secretmessage.py) - if statement, blocks of code (10 min)
5. Magic 8 Ball - 20 min  
    1. [magic8ball.py](../code/magic8ball.py) - basic fortune (random number, if statement)
    2. [magic8ball.py](../code/magic8ball-v2.py) - repeated in a loop (while-loop)
6. [number-guessing-game.py](../code/number-guessing-game.py) - random numbers, if statements, loops, compound
                      boolean condition
