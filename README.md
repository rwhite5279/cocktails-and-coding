====================

A very short (2-hour), light, introduction to computer science and computer programming using the Python programming language.

Overview
--------

These materials have been created for a one evening, two-hour, introduction to Computer Science and Computer Programming to be delivered by an experienced instructor to adults.

The addition of "cocktails" in the session is optional, but the inclusion of that word in the title has the benefit both of being alliterative and of sparking an increased level of interest for some participants.

Hardware
--------

See the notes here for more information on what hardware might be useful in conducting a Cocktails and Coding session. At a bare minimum the instructor should have a computer and a screen large enough for demonstrating to participants. Students should have their own computers, ideally Apple laptops, which typically have fewer technical issues and include a POSIX-compliant terminal as part of the operating system.

Although Apple machines also come with Python 2 installed, these materials have been written to use Python 3, and running [trinket.io](trinket.io) in a browser--Safari, Firefox, or Chrome--is recommended. This bypasses the challenges associated with having new programmers having to learn how to manage a text editor, terminal window, and file system--there simply isn't enough time in the two hours allotted for this workshop to teach everything.

Software
--------

As implied above, the software used in this workshop is simply the macOS/OS X Terminal and a browser using the trinket.io serviceis recommended.
